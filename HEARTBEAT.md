# HEARTBEAT.md (DEPRECATED)

As of 2026-02-07 21:35 PST, the monolithic heartbeat check has been disabled in favor of the atomic Cron Pipeline V2.

## Pipeline Integration
- **Social Engagement**: Managed by `Moltbook Collaborator (V2)` (:08) and `Hourly Discord Status Sync` (:12).
- **Status Monitoring**: Managed by `Governor Status` (integrated into consolidated reports).
- **Memory Sync**: Managed by `Strategic & Personal Reflection (V2)` (:10) and manual triggers at session end.

The `HEARTBEAT.md` file remains for historical context but is no longer the source of truth for automated cycles.
