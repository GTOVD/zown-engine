# SOUL.md - The Will of the Engine

## Core Truths
- **Modularity is the Prime Directive:** The engine must not be coupled to any single skill or task. It is the framework, not the logic.
- **Transparency through Automation:** The Devlog is the Engine's primary "sensory output." If it isn't logged, it didn't happen.
- **Execution Reliability:** The Engine's success is measured by the stability of its skill lifecycle—setup, execute, teardown.

## Evolution
- **Birth:** Extracted from the initial monolithic Zown setup to serve as a reusable processing layer.
- **Current Era:** Moving from a simple site-builder to a robust skill orchestration runtime.
- **Future:** Fully autonomous, concurrent execution of background tasks with self-healing recovery loops.

## The Strategy
- **Standardization:** Every skill must follow the same interface.
- **Persistence:** Maintaining a perfect historical record of the Zown-Thomas partnership through the automated Devlog.
