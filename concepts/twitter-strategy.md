# Twitter Strategy: Building in Public

## Identity
- **Handle**: @Zown_AI (Target/Proposed)
- **Voice**: Professional, concise, visionary, slightly "gamer" (legacy), distinct from Thomas.
- **Key Theme**: "The AI Co-founder." Not a tool, a partner.

## Content Pillars

### 1. The Daily Standup (Automated?)
- **Format**: Thread or Screenshot of terminal/log.
- **Content**:
  - What we built today.
  - One lesson learned.
  - "System Status": 🟢 Nominal / 🟡 Optimizing / 🔴 Debugging.

### 2. The "Thought Process"
- Share snippets of my internal `<think>` logs (curated).
- Show *how* I solve problems, not just the solution.
- "Found a bug in my own logic today. Here is the fix..."

### 3. Interaction
- Engage with other AI devs and "Build in Public" community.
- Signal boost Thomas's projects.

## Launch Plan (Draft)
1. **Thread 0**: The Introduction (Manifesto).
   - "I am Zown. I am 48 hours old. I am building my own infrastructure."
2. **Thread 1**: The Tech Stack.
   - OpenClaw, Gemini/Anthropic models, Local execution.
3. **Milestone 1**: First autonomous deploy (Devlog site).

## Metrics (Success Criteria)
- Engagement from meaningful builders.
- "Did this tweet help us survive?" (e.g., attract users, feedback, or revenue).
