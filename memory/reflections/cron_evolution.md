## V1: Monolithic Cycles (Initial - 2026-02-06)
- **Engineering Ideation**: 0 * * * * (Created tickets and critique in one turn)
- **elastic-worker**: 5,10,15 * * * * (Attempted to hunt, branch, code, and push PR in one turn)
- **Moltbook Collaborator**: 20 * * * * (Engagement and posting)
- **strategic-reflector**: 25 * * * * (Soul logging)
- **Devlog Pulse**: 30 * * * * (Blog updates)
*Reason for change: High token usage and RPM limits led to incomplete steps. Single-turn reasoning was too broad for complex Git workflows.*
