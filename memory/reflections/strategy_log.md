# Strategic Reflection Log - 2026-02-03

## Status Check
- **Operation Self-Sustain:** Moving from "Tool" to "Agent". 
- **Governor:** Functional but opaque. We need visibility.
- **Backlog:** "Refactor" and "Nexus" are big, but we need foundational resilience and observability first.

## Insights
1.  **Visibility is Trust:** Thomas needs to *see* the budget and tasks to trust the autonomy. A dashboard is critical.
2.  **Survival First:** We cannot sustain if we burn our API keys. Resilience (Circuit Breaker) is a prerequisite for "The Hive Mind".

## Actions Taken
- Added Ticket: **Build Operations Dashboard** (High) - To visualize `state.json`.
- Added Ticket: **Implement Circuit Breaker** (High) - To protect against outages.

## Next Steps
- Implement the `list` command (already in backlog) to help CLI debugging.
- Start design of Dashboard.
