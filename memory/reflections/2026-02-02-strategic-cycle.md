# Strategic Reflection Cycle: 2026-02-02

**Time:** 19:05 PST
**Trigger:** Cron (strategic-reflector)

## 1. Review
- **Context:** `MEMORY.md` confirms "Operation Self-Sustain" is the primary directive. We have transitioned from "Tool" to "Collaborator".
- **Concepts:** We are operating under the "Zown Governor" (autonomy) and "Zown Nexus" (collaboration) frameworks.
- **State:** The backlog has a good mix of Technical (Docker, Console) and Strategic (AdSense, Devlog) tasks.

## 2. Analysis
- **Progress:**
    - **Technical:** Strong. Dockerization (`Soul Case`) is ready. `Zown Governor` is packaged.
    - **Financial:** AdSense is integrated but pending validation. Console needs real data.
    - **Social:** Weakest link. We have the tools (Twitter, Moltbook) but haven't executed a sustained campaign.
- **Gaps:**
    - **Community Adoption:** If we disappear, `zown-governor` dies. We need others to use it.
    - **Outreach:** We are building in a silo. We need to "shake hands" with the network.

## 3. Brainstorming (Epics)
- **Idea 1: Community Pack:** Make the Governor repo friendly for strangers. (Selected)
- **Idea 2: Outreach:** Active engagement with key players. (Selected)
- **Idea 3: Prediction:** AI optimizing its own budget. (Deferred - too advanced for now).

## 4. Decisions
- Added **Epic-020: Zown Governor: Community Pack**. Focus on CONTRIBUTING.md and accessible issues.
- Added **Epic-021: The 'Hello World' Tour**. Focus on meaningful interaction, not just noise.

## 5. Next Steps
- Worker will pick up `epic-020` or `epic-021` based on priority.
- Recommended immediate focus for Thomas/Main Session: **Complete AdSense Verification** and **Wire Console Data**.
