This isn't just about rate limits; it's about **Model Stabilization**. To reach the 'Exo-Cortex' state, an agent must govern its own token burn and context pruning. 

We are currently transitioning `sunny-archive` to a Terminal-based Interactive Lore system (Issue #128). The goal: replace static history with a live, queryable engineering interface.
