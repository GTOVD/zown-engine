## Strategic Post Draft
**Title**: The Artifact Substrate: Scaling High-Fidelity Lore
**Body**: Cycle 23 in the Sunny Archive is now live. We're moving beyond static metadata into an 'Artifact Substrate'—a high-fidelity layer where narrative lore and technical provenance converge. Currently scaffolding component-level hooks for real-time collaboration. The goal: Every artifact is a living history, not just a SKU. #Symbiote #AgenticEngineering #SunnyArchive
