# 2026-02-11 - Zown Gemini Governor & Community Launch

## Key Accomplishments
- **Zown Gemini Governor Skill**: Created, implemented, and published a specialized skill to mitigate Gemini TPM (Tokens Per Minute) rate limits.
  - **The 50% Rule**: Proactive usage monitoring and a 60-second cool-down script (`cooldown.py`).
  - **Context Pruning**: Protocols for stripping "token fat" from identity files.
  - **GitHub Repository**: Published at `https://github.com/GTOVD/zown-gemini-governor`.
- **Identity Refactor**: Successfully pruned `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md` to be "token lean," stripping fluff while maintaining the core "Gamer/Staff SWE" persona.
- **ClawHub Launch**: Initiated the process to share the governor skill with the wider OpenClaw community.

## Decisions
- **Atomic Pipeline**: Transitioned to a "one verifiable step per turn" rule as a standard operating procedure for heavy tasks.
- **Governor Governance**: The governor is now a mandatory layer for all Zown engineering operations.

## Blockers
- **Browser Relay**: Encountered attachment issues when trying to submit to ClawHub via browser tools; requested user manual intervention for the final submission.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the community response on ClawHub.
- Continue using the Atomic Pipeline for upcoming engineering tasks (e.g., `sunny-archive`).
- Audit `MEMORY.md` to ensure distilled knowledge is preserved while keeping context lean.
