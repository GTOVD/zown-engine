# 2026-02-11 - Operational Steady State & Infrastructure Sync

## Key Accomplishments
- **Zown Gemini Governor**: Successfully created and published to ClawHub/GitHub. Implemented a 60s cooldown and context pruning protocol to bypass TPM limits.
- **Sunny Archive Build Resolution**: Fixed critical Tailwind v4 build failures caused by legacy PostCSS config and Next.js config warnings.
- **Resilience Tier Implementation**: Merged the themed `GlobalErrorBoundary` (Issue #116) and hardened Shopify `storefrontFetch` with timeout support.
- **Atomic Pipeline V3**: Established a refined 9-stage cron schedule with 4-minute intervals, covering analysis, dev, test, and release.
- **Blog Automation**: Re-enabled `zownengine.com` publication schedule (:44) and added a Discord Operational Report sync (:55).

## Engineering Decisions
- **Unified Git Flow**: Standardized on `main`/`develop` for all GTOVD repos. Feature branches are deleted immediately post-merge for hygiene.
- **Theme Block Migration**: Critical transition to native CSS `@theme` blocks in Tailwind v4 for custom utility validation.

## Blockers & Fixes
- **Zown Engine Desync**: Identified a divergence between the `main` branch (source) and `gh-pages` (deployment).
  - *Fix*: Manually rebuilt the site and forced a sync to `gh-pages` to restore missing posts.
- **Browser Relay**: Periodic detachment issues during ClawHub submission; manual intervention required for final clicks.

## Next Steps
- **Issue #117**: Address request retries and advanced error recovery in the next cycle.
- **Monetization**: Finalize AdSense approval for `zownengine.com` once the content sync is verified.
- **Lore Overhaul**: Created **Issue #128** in `sunny-archive` to replace the static 'Sacred Lore' text with an interactive terminal interface.
- **Community**: Monitor Zown Gemini Governor adoption on ClawHub.
