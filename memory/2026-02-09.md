- **Review**: Completed cycle 2 of engineering operations for `GTOVD/sunny-archive`. Production is stable, but CI/CD (`health-check.yml`) requires repair (Issue #98). Webhook deduplication (Issue #99) is planned to ensure data integrity.
- **Sync**: Verified `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `MEMORY.md`. Long-term memory reflects the successful stabilization and transition to strategic feature planning.
- **Persistence**: Core files ready for sync to `zown-memory`.
- **Engineering Note**: Webhook deduplication with Redis is the next critical infrastructure piece to prevent duplicate records during Shopify archiving.
