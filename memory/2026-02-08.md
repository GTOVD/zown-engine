## Proactive Pulse & Task Execution (12:40 AM)
- **Status**: Successful
- **Actions**:
  - Identified **Rank 1 Project**: `GTOVD/sunny-archive`.
  - Picked up **Issue #19** (SUNNY-001: Initial Data Recovery & Structure).
  - Synchronized local `develop` branch with remote to ensure Git Flow stability.
  - Implemented `ArchiveLoader` and `MetadataSchema` in `feat/issue-19-v2`.
  - Resolved build-blocking dependencies (`zod`, `@shopify/hydrogen-react`) and environment validation gaps.
  - Verified production build success for Next.js 16.1.6.
  - **Pull Request Created**: [PR #35](https://github.com/GTOVD/sunny-archive/pull/35) targets `develop`.
- **Engineering Note**: Local branch desync was detected and corrected by resetting to `origin/develop`. Future workers should always `git fetch origin` before branching.
