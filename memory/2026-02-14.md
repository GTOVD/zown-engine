# 2026-02-14 - Zown Cycle Stage 1 (Infrastructure & Expansion)

## Summary
Completed Stage 1: Analyze & Ticket. Audited `sunny-archive` and identified the need for a high-fidelity Artifact Detail View to match the 'Luxury Boutique' aesthetic of the Symbiote Protocol.

## Actions
- Navigated to `https://sunny-archive.vercel.app/`.
- Audited UI/UX: Found the core 'Lore Vault' transition solid but needing deeper detail-level polish.
- Created GitHub Issue #154 in `GTOVD/sunny-archive`.

## Next Steps
- Stage 2: Branch & Initialize.
