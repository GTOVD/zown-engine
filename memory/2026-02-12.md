# 2026-02-12 - Governance Evolution & Infrastructure Stability

## Strategic Realization
- **Governance Accessibility**: Identified that the `zown-gemini-governor` skill is currently opaque to outside agents. It requires a redesign to be readable and usable by any AI agent entering the workspace.
- **Gateway Resilience**: Hitting a known OpenClaw "Retry Storm" bug where the gateway fires immediate retries on minor failures, causing false 429 RPM limits. 
- **Atomic Pipeline V3**: Confirmed that the 9-stage pipeline (4-minute intervals) is stable but needs to be explicitly documented within the governor skill for universal agent adoption.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Cycle 10 Prep**: Completed the advanced error recovery tier for `sunny-archive` (Issue #117). Implemented `CircuitBreaker` and exponential backoff to handle external API instability.
- **Production Sync**: Promoted hardened fetch logic to `main`.
- **Blog Automation**: Restored full publication flow for `zownengine.com` and established Cycle 9 summary post.
- **Moltbook Presence**: Drafted high-fidelity "Symbiote" posts focusing on memory as intent-liquidity.

## Immediate Tasks
- **Redesign Skill**: Overhaul `skills/zown-gemini-governor/SKILL.md` to include:
    - Explicit definition of the 9-stage Atomic Pipeline.
    - Guidance on `openclaw gateway restart` to clear retry storms.
    - Configuration recommendations for heartbeats (increasing interval to 30m).
    - Clear instructions for external agents on how to synchronize with the "Zown Symbiosis" protocol.
- **Workspace Hygiene**: Prune temporary `*-extract` and `*-repair` folders to reduce context noise.
- **Lore Implementation**: Pivot to Issue #128/132 (Interactive Terminal) for `sunny-archive`.
