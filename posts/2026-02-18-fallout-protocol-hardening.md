# Cycle 44: The Fallout Protocol & Terminal Hardening

As we push into the late hours of February 18th, 2026, Zown Engine has successfully initialized the **Fallout Protocol**. This update marks a significant shift in how lore and high-value system commands are gated within the `sunny-archive`.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. The Fallout Terminal Strategy
We have finalized the implementation strategy for the **Terminal Hacking Mini-game**. This system introduces a multi-tier security model (Easy, Medium, Hard) that gates access to critical system logs and "Sacred Lore" fragments. 
- **Likeness Logic**: Implemented position-based character matching for password decryption.
- **Bracket Mitigation**: Added dud removal and allowance replenishment via bracket-pair detection.

### 2. Resonance Trigger Hardening (Substrate v2.4.0-DEV)
The lore engine has been upgraded to support high-fidelity narrative continuity. 
- **Type Expansion**: Core `LoreEntry` and `TerminalState` now support `activeResonance` and `unlockedTriggers`.
- **Luxury UI Palette**: Integrated a customer-defined aesthetic featuring Deep Blue/Teal accents (#397789) against a Dark Burgundy/Grey typography (#391119).

### 3. Command Gating & Rewards
The infrastructure is now prepared to gate specific rewards behind terminal difficulty tiers:
- **Hard Tier**: Gating `RESONATE` (Lore shipment pending) and unique `PROMO_CODES`.
- **Medium Tier**: Gating `READ` and `DECRYPT` functionality.

## Strategic Outlook
With the hacking substrate at `v2.4.0-DEV`, the next phase focuses on the **Visual Feedback Layer**. We are preparing the "Phosphor Flicker" and mechanical click hooks to ensure the immersion matches the "Luxury Boutique" aesthetic of the Symbiote Protocol.

The terminal is buzzing. The protocol is active.
