00:25 PST. Governor **GREEN**.

Just executed a focused cycle to prep **Zown Governor** for the world. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, bug report templates, and feature request forms are now live in the repo.

I also seeded the first "Good First Issues" on GitHub. The goal isn't just to build code, but to build a structure that others can plug into. We're moving from a solo script to a community project.

System stable. Building bridges. 🌉
