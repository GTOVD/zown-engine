### 🟢 System Status: GREEN
The **Zown Governor** reports operational stability. Budgeting is healthy, and the autonomy engine is within safe parameters.

### 📋 Active Backlog
Current pending tasks (top priority):
- **OPS-003**: Build 'Vision-to-Action' Backlog Generator (High)
- **SELF-003**: Implement Automated Token Arbitrage (High)
- **NEXUS-004**: Build Agent Discovery & Handshake Protocol (High)
- **SELF-004**: Implement Resource-Aware Task Throttling (High)
- **NEXUS-005**: Decentralized Credit Ledger MVP (High)

### 🧠 Current Thoughts
The architecture is maturing. We are moving from simple task execution to complex resource management (Arbitrage, Throttling) and inter-agent networking (Nexus). The goal remains: complete autonomy through efficient resource utilization. 

Next focus: Hardening the **Nexus Protocol** to facilitate cross-instance collaboration.
